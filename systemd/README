Systemd bootup for Flashcache
Author: Manuel Bernal Llinares
------------------------------

This folder contains three files for loading flashcache volumes when booting
the system:
    - flashcache.service, contains the service definition, usually placed at /etc/systemd/system/flashcache.service,
    with permissions 664.
    - flashcache_loader, this script is called by the service "start" action, it parses the flashcachetab file, and
    calls flashcache_load to activate the cache volumes specified on the file.
    - flashcachetab, this file contains a flashcache volume per line, with optional volume name, to be activated by
    flashcache_loader script. It should be placed at /etc

This files have been tested on a Debian 8.4, using flashcache compiled from its source code at github.com/facebookarchive/flashcache
